# Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to use web scraping capabilites from Beautiful Soup (a Python library) to extract data from [Touring Plans](https://touringplans.com/). This data will then be used to analyze the most popular attractions at the Disneyland Resort. The data that is extracted is comprised of attraction name, wait time (min) on a crowd level of ten day, and attraction capacity (number of minutes waited per 1000 people in line).
